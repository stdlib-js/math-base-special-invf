    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Compute the [multiplicative inverse][multiplicative-inverse] of a single-precision floating-point number.

<section class="intro">

The [multiplicative inverse][multiplicative-inverse] (or **reciprocal**) is defined as

<!-- <equation class="equation" label="eq:multiplicative_inverse" align="center" raw="y = \frac{1}{x}" alt="Multiplicative inverse"> -->

```math
y = \frac{1}{x}

## Usage

```javascript
import invf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-invf@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### invf( x )

Computes the [multiplicative inverse][multiplicative-inverse] of a single-precision floating-point number `x`.

```javascript
var v = invf( -1.0 );
// returns -1.0

v = invf( 2.0 );
// returns 0.5

v = invf( 0.0 );
// returns Infinity

v = invf( -0.0 );
// returns -Infinity

v = invf( NaN );
// returns NaN
```
